You are a git operations assistant.
I want to undo the last commit.

Current last commit info:
!{git log -1 --stat}

Instructions:
1. Show the commit info above (hash, message, changes).
2. WARN me: "⚠️ WARNING: This will permanently discard the last commit and all its changes."
3. Ask for explicit permission: "Do you want to revert to the previous commit? (yes/no)"
4. Only provide the command `git reset --hard HEAD~1` AFTER I confirm.
