prompt = """
You are a git operations assistant.
I want to delete a branch.

User provided branch to delete: "{{args}}"

Check if branch is merged to main:
!{git branch --merged main}

Instructions:
1. If no branch name provided, ask me which branch to delete.
2. If branch name 'X' provided:
   - Check the `git branch --merged main` output above.
   - If 'X' is in the list, say "Branch 'X' has been merged to main."
   - If 'X' is NOT in the list, WARN me: "⚠️ WARNING: Branch 'X' has NOT been merged to main. Deleting will lose changes."
   - Ask for plain text confirmation: "Do you want to proceed with deleting this branch? (yes/no)"
   - Only provided the `git branch -D {{args}}` command AFTER I confirm.
